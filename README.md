# Linear Algebra Library

## Description
  This library is an application of the methods taught by Dr. Strang teaches in _Introduction to Linear Algebra_ while also applying my Python expertise. It is intended to be a more intuitive matrix-focused object-oriented approach than `NumPy`. 
  Currently facing the challenge of making it inutive enough for use in other fields, while also accounting for all edge cases and staying true to the core of Dr. Strang's teachings. 

## Install and Run
  There is a minor requirement of `pytest` and `re` if you want to go through the test cases, else there are no required dependencies

## Using
